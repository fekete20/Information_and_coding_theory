Repository of Information and coding theory MSc course.

Task: 

Create a program that performs Shannon-Fano encoding!
Read data (source distribution) from a text file. Write out the result into text file.
Determine the entropy efficiency for the encoding.
Source and executable versions and program description should be submitted including at least 5 running examples.

Description:

The source code and executable version of the program can also be found in this folder. The executable version is 
the JAR file in the Shannon-Fano_coding_assignment/Executable_JAR directory. It is important that downloading the 
"files" folder in the directory is also essential for a fault-free run, because it contains the resources that the 
program works with.

To run the ShannonFano_assignment.jar file, type java -jar ShannonFano_assignment.jar command into the terminal or 
command line(it is necessary to have JAVA installed on the computer).

The output will be displayed in the command line with the sub-steps, while the result.txt files in the "files" 
directory will contain the encoded text with the encoding efficiency.
